0,Oligo/azoospermia in Nigeria,"Oligo/azoospermia contributes significantly to infertility in male Nigerians, being responsible for most of the problem. By definition, it would appear that the criteria for the diagnosis of this problem in Nigerians should be sperm density below 10 million/ml, total sperm ejaculate below 25 million, motility below 40%, and normal forms below 40% in agreement with more recent findings in other parts of the world. This reinforces the already generally accepted that the WHO may need to review its criteria for diagnosing oligo/azoospermia. Preventable causes of oligo/azoospermia in Nigeria include poorly treated infections such as venereal diseases, delayed treatment of torsion of the testis and of undescended testis, and repair of inguinal hernia by inexperienced native doctor [3, 4]. In addition, better approaches to the diagnosis of causes of infertility, such as a careful search for and rational treatment of varicocele, may improve the chances of infertile couples. Hormonal disorders are important factors to consider in oligo/azoospermic Nigerians, as with their counterparts elsewhere. Wide-spread availability of hormonal assays will therefore be a great help in separating the untreatable (primary testicular disease) from the treatable (hypothalamic/pituitary) diseases and planning rational treatment. With improvement of clinical care, many more patients with sickle-cell disease are reaching reproductive age. Oligo/azoospermia is quite common in patients with sickle-cell disease, and sickle-cell disease will eventually contribute more proportionately to the etiology of oligo/azoospermia in Nigerians. Extensive investigations have been conducted on the nature, etiology, and diagnosis of oligo/azoospermia [2-11, 25, 30-56].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

3,Mother's knowledge of sickle-cell anaemia in Nigeria,"The study ascertains knowledge of mothers of sufferers of sickle-cell anaemia specifically regarding aetiology of the disorder and acceptable medical care. One hundred fifty-seven mothers of children suffering from sickle-cell anaemia (HbSS) attending a haematology clinic of a general hospital in Lagos were randomly sampled and asked about the aetiology and their understanding of the rules of care using a short open-ended questionnaire. The mean age of the mothers was 37.4 and a significant majority belong to the lower socio-economic strata. Thirty-four percent reported having been informed of the hereditary basis of anaemia but 48.4% received no explanation. Doctors, nurses, and lay literature were the main sources of information on the condition, as well as its medical care. The considerable gaps in appropriate knowledge on sickle-cell anaemia in Nigeria observed indicates that adequate and properly-presented information to parents or guardians of patients should be an essential part of a comprehensive care plan."

6,Impact of intestinal parasites on haematological parameters of sickle-cell anaemia patients in Nigeria,"The majority of patients with sickle-cell anaemia live in the underdeveloped nations where endemic parasitic diseases are prevalent and this may exacerbate the severity of steady-state anaemia in infected patients. We studied the impact of intestinal parasites on haematological parameters of sickle-cell anaemia patients aged 18-35 years in Kano, Nigeria. Of 100 patients studied, 27 were found to be infected with intestinal parasites. There were no significant differences between patients with and without parasitic infections with respect to leukocyte and platelet counts. However, patients without parasitic infections had a significantly higher mean haematocrit than patients with parasitic infections [0.27 L/L (SD 0.03) versus 0.23 (SD 0.03) L/L]. Anaemia in sickle-cell anaemia patients may be exacerbated by intestinal parasites, and these patients should have regular stool examinations for detection and treatment of parasitic infections in order to improve their haematocrit and avoid the risk of blood transfusion."
